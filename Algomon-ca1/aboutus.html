            <p> We believe in the power of positive play and that being part of a gaming community should be a fun, fair,
                and safe experience for all. We are equally committed to building a workplace that spurs creativity and
                innovation and is as diverse as the communities we serve.
    
                 As a leading global entertainment business, we want to inspire through our actions and create a positive
                impact in the world. This is not a destination but an ongoing journey of transparency and continual
                progress. You can find out how we are getting on, and read our Impact Report.</p>
